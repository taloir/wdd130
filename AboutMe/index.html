    <h2>Landon McConnell</h2>
    <p>Hey everybody, I'm Landon. I am a lifetime member of the Church of Jesus Christ, and I consider my service as a missionary to be the most important detail to know about me. I served in the Washington, Vancouver mission from Sep.2019 to Sep.2021, and I try to act like I'm still wearing the tag as much as I can. Since returning, I work full time as a gas pump attendant, teach primary at church, and host a server on discord where me and my friends write our own world, characters and stories together. That group is called The IHU. (short for International Heroes Union.)</p>
    <p>I still don't fully know what career path I want to follow inside of web development. I am of the mindset of first getting the skills, and then narrowing down opportunities from there. I do however look forward to using these skills to create convenient platforms to organize and present my creative works and host other programming projects.</p>
