      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Main page - about me:
The main page of the site will focus mostly on me as a creator and how players can support the community I'm building. It will explain my passion for creating, and how I gather ideas day by day until inspiration strikes, and something new emerges from the primordial soup. This page will need to discuss the fact that I can't manage these servers alone, and that I have friends who help maintain them on a volunteer basis. Indeed, I don't want to manage it alone, because that takes all of the fun out of it: I want my players to share ownership of what we make together. Then it should elaborate on the kind of community I am trying to create, and values and standards of conduct I expect my community to hold.

Main page - supporting the community:
It should provide instructions for anyone interested in similarly volunteering on how to contact us and get involved. It should also discuss how important community creators are, and the rights status of content created by the community. Then it will give a brief introduction for each of the discord server games, and link people to their respective pages and servers.

      <h3>Metamon</h3>
      <p>
        Metamon - premise:
For the Metamon page, it will start with a description of the game premise, and an explanation that the freedom of creativity to be involved in designing your own characters and to roleplay their actions and relationships with each other is what makes the game special.

Metamon - how to play:
Then it should explain the rules of the game: how to get your first metamon and understand their stats, how to use the Gandr diceroller to conduct a match, how you earn new metaforms, and finally how the metamorphosis mechanic works. Then we can provide a link to the server.

Metamon - extra details and support us:
Players will also need to learn about gyms, events, legendary metamon, and how to navigate the server. Then it should provide a section explaining how to provide feedback on the game, and offering instructions for contacting us to volunteer as a creator, event planner, technology specialist, loremaster, or something else.

      <p>
        IHU - Setting premise
After that explanation, diving into explaining the setting premise. Besides the basic details of what kinds of things exist in the world, what the Union is, how it impacts peoples lives, and the role that powers play in the world, a link should be provided to the full lore repository instead of unfolding it all right there on the page. We will also need an explanation of what elements are expressly banned from lore.

IHU - getting started
Then character creation will be explained and a link to character submission will be provided. Then and only then will the site explain how to request roleplay and get into a game, and link to the server. 

IHU - 
A section will be provided explaining how to submit lore suggestions. Another will link people to where they can vote on critical lore elements. and then instructions should be given on how to submit suggestions for how to improve the organization of lore, tips and tricks for better roleplay, and to volunteer as a loremaster.
