        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>The IHU page will need to start with an explanation of what roleplay games are for those who dont know, and then an explanation that this isn't like most roleplay people are familiar with, as it has almost no real rules. Then it needs to reinforce community standards about roleplay conduct and maintaining internal consistency.</p>
        <img src="images/Gate.jpg" alt="A superhero in riot gear">
        <p>After that explanation, diving into explaining the setting premise. Besides the basic details of what kinds of things exist in the world, what the Union is, how it impacts peoples lives, and the role that powers play in the world, a link should be provided to the full lore repository instead of unfolding it all right there on the page. We will also need an explanation of what elements are expressly banned from lore.</p>
